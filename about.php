I am a hardworking student that has started college a year early. I am a learning C#, C++, Java, VHDL, Web, and databases student. I have programmed two apps for the Windows Phone Store that have received over 3000 downloads. I enjoy working with technology and I always like to learn more about them. I am currently studying at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I enjoy going on hackerrank.com or projecteuler.net in my free time.
