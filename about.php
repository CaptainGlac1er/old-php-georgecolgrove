I am learning C#, C++, Java, VHDL, Web development, and databases. I overhauled the start page for RIT and included a mobile friendly version. I have programmed two apps for the Windows Phone Store that has received over 3000 downloads. I enjoy working with technology and I always like to learn more advanced technologies. I am currently studying at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I enjoy going on hackerrank.com or projecteuler.net in my free time.
